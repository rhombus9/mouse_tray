"""Driver package.

Importing this package imports every driver module, which runs their
``@register`` decorators and populates the registry. Drivers live in two
subpackages: ``chipset/`` for shared-silicon protocols (named after the chipset,
spanning whatever brands rebrand it) and ``vendor/`` for brand-specific
protocols. Adding one means dropping a module in the right subpackage and listing
it in ``_DRIVER_MODULES`` below.

Public API: :func:`detect_all_drivers`, :func:`all_drivers`, plus the building
blocks :class:`MouseModel`, :class:`MouseDriver` and :func:`register`.
